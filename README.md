# Hand geometry based identification
In this project, I have used Matlab to first explore different Classifiers that can be used to identify person using handprints. There are two text files with co-ordinates for testing and training. The output files are also stored as text outputs.

The complete classifier is defined as one Matlab function so that it can be used multiple times for more complex codes. First, feature extraction is done in order to clean and prepare data. This helps to consider only relevant datapoints which decreases overall computation.

An Ensemble model is trained on the training set and then predictions are done on the test set. The output is saved as text files.

An in-depth report is attached for further details.
